In './src', all the source codes are in this file, including bank model and python.

For plot, I use Python and its library 'matplotlib' to draw a figure with average time and std. The test parameters are 'key_max = 50, tiers - 20, threads = "1,2,4,8"'. Based on the plot, we can see that larger threads number, more time is needed. That's because using locks and the execution methods.

For the bank model, you can type 'make' to compile it. The exe files are in './src/obj32', which compiled from SunLab. For the design, I use a global lock to lock the deposit and balance, which verify the result is correct. 

If you have any questions, feel free to contact with me. Thank you so much!
